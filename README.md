# Installation instructions 
Go to the "Releases" page and download the latest version of the mod for your console, then unzip the file you downloaded. Once you have followed the steps for your console/emulator of choice, bootup Miitopia and check if the title-screen has loaded. This will indicate that the mod has been installed.

## For Switch Emulator (Yuzu/Ryujinx)
Open your preferred emulator, and make sure Miitopia is added as a game directory. <br> Right click Miitopia and click the button that is for your emulator

Yuzu: `Open Mod Data Location` <br> Ryujinx: `Open Mods Directory`

Drag the Extracted zip folder into that directory. 

## For a homebrewed Switch
Open your microSD card, and create a folder in `atmosphere\contents\` called `01007DA0140E8000`. <br> If any of these folders don't exist, create said folders. 
<br> 

## For Citra
Make sure Miitopia is added as a game directory. <br> Right click Miitopia and click `Open Mods location`. <br> Drag the `romfs` folder from the zip you extracted earlier into the mod directoory.

## For a homebrewed 3DS
On your SD Card, navigate to  a folder called ```luma\titles\```. <br> If this folder hasn't been made, you can make it. <br> Inside that directory, create another folder named with the title-id depending on your region. <br> <br>US: `00040000001B4E00` <br> EU: `00040000001B4F00` <br> <br>
